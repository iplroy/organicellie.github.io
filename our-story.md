<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-6">Why I Started Organic Ellie</h1>

<p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">It all started the moment I held my daughter, Eliana, in my arms.</p>

<p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Becoming a mother changed everything for me.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      When my daughter Eliana was born, I felt a fierce, beautiful responsibility — not just to love and nurture her, but to protect her from the invisible dangers hiding in everyday life. I started looking more closely at the things I used: baby lotion, laundry detergent, plastic bottles, even the wipes I once assumed were harmless.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      The more I researched, the more I realized how many products marketed to moms were full of toxins, artificial fragrances, and ingredients I couldn’t even pronounce. I felt overwhelmed. But I also felt empowered — because I knew I could make better choices, and I knew I wasn’t alone.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      That’s how <strong>Organic Ellie</strong> was born — a mama’s journey into clean, conscious living.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      This space is my love letter to Eliana… and to every parent who’s ever paused at a label and thought: <em>“Is this really safe for my baby?”</em>
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 text-lg">
      <li>🍼 <strong>Clean product recommendations</strong> I’ve researched and used</li>
      <li>📚 <strong>Tips and resources</strong> for a non-toxic home</li>
      <li>💬 <strong>Honest stories</strong> of trial, learning, and motherhood</li>
      <li>🛍️ <strong>A shop</strong> featuring the brands I trust and believe in</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Organic Ellie</strong> isn’t about perfection — it’s about <strong>progress</strong>, intention, and choosing what’s best for our little ones and ourselves.
