# 🌱 Why I Started Organic Ellie

It all started the moment I held my daughter, Eliana, in my arms.

Becoming a mother changed everything for me.

When my daughter Eliana was born, I felt a fierce, beautiful responsibility — not just to love and nurture her, but to protect her from the invisible dangers hiding in everyday life. I started looking more closely at the things I used: baby lotion, laundry detergent, plastic bottles, even the wipes I once assumed were harmless.

The more I researched, the more I realized how many products marketed to moms were full of toxins, artificial fragrances, and ingredients I couldn’t even pronounce. I felt overwhelmed. But I also felt empowered — because I knew I could make better choices, and I knew I wasn’t alone.

That’s how **Organic Ellie** was born — a mama’s journey into clean, conscious living.

This space is my love letter to Eliana… and to every parent who’s ever paused at a label and thought: _“Is this really safe for my baby?”_

- 🍼 **Clean product recommendations** I’ve researched and used  
- 📚 **Tips and resources** for a non‑toxic home  
- 💬 **Honest stories** of trial, learning, and motherhood  
- 🛍️ **A shop** featuring the brands I trust and believe in  

**Organic Ellie** isn’t about perfection — it’s about **progress**, intention, and choosing what’s best for our little ones and ourselves.

With love,
