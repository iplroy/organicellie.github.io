Pregnancy is a sacred journey—one filled with excitement, questions, and transformation. At *Organic Ellie*, we believe that embracing an organic lifestyle in these early weeks isn’t just about what you eat or buy—it’s about how you live, love, and care for yourself and your growing baby.

## 🌿 What to Expect in the First Trimester

- Morning sickness or nausea (not just in the morning!)
- Fatigue or extreme tiredness
- Tender breasts
- Frequent urination
- Mood swings or heightened emotions
- Food aversions or intense cravings

## 🍎 What to Do: Holistic, Organic Practices for the First Trimester

### 1. Nourish with Clean, Whole Foods
Focus on organic produce, pasture-raised proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods and opt for folate-rich greens, legumes, and fortified grains. Iron, calcium, and vitamin D are also key. Always confirm prenatal supplements with your doctor.

### 2. Choose Clean Prenatal Vitamins
Select vitamins free from synthetic dyes or binders. Look for methylated folate (5-MTHF) for better absorption, especially if you have the MTHFR gene variation.

### 3. Switch to Non-Toxic Skincare and Home Products
Use plant-based skincare, mineral sunscreens, and organic oils. Avoid phthalates, parabens, formaldehyde, and artificial fragrance in both personal and cleaning products.

### 4. Hydrate and Detox Gently
Drink plenty of filtered water and choose glass or stainless steel over plastic. Gentle herbal teas like ginger or peppermint (with provider approval) can help ease nausea.

### 5. Prioritize Gentle Movement and Rest
Prenatal yoga, walks, and stretching support circulation and ease discomfort. Honor your fatigue—rest often and unapologetically.

## ⚠️ Precautions Advised by Doctors

### What to Avoid

- Unpasteurized dairy or juices
- Deli meats and raw seafood
- Excessive caffeine (limit to ~200 mg/day)
- Essential oils unless approved
- Hot tubs or saunas

### What to Monitor

- Unusual cramping or bleeding
- Persistent nausea and dehydration
- High fevers (above 100.4°F)
- Mental health concerns—seek support early

## 🧘‍♀️ Mindful, Soulful Support

Journaling, meditation, vision boards, and mama circles can nourish your heart as much as your body. Say no when you need to and protect your energy fiercely. Pregnancy is a time of intuitive wisdom—listen to it.

### 💚 Your baby’s story begins now—and so does yours as a mother.

By living intentionally and organically, you’re creating the safest, softest start—for both of you. 💚
